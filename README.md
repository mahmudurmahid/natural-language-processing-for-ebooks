# 📚 Natural Language Processing for Ebooks

The **Natural Language Processing for Ebooks** project explores various NLP techniques applied to ebook texts. It provides a series of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate text preprocessing, analysis, and visualization methods using Python's NLP libraries.

This project is ideal for students, researchers, and enthusiasts interested in applying NLP to literary texts.

## 🧠 User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

As a user, I want to:

- Analyze the textual content of ebooks using NLP techniques.
- Understand the frequency and distribution of words and phrases.
- Visualize textual data to gain insights into the content.
- Learn how to apply NLP methods to literary texts through practical examples.

## 🎨 Design

### Notebook Structure

Each Jupyter notebook in this project follows a structured approach:

1. **Introduction**: Overview of the analysis objectives.
2. **Data Loading**: Reading the ebook text files.
3. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data.
4. **Analysis**: Applying NLP techniques such as tokenization, frequency analysis, etc.
5. **Visualization**: Presenting findings through charts and graphs.
6. **Conclusion**: Summarizing insights and potential next steps.

### Data Source

- The primary text used for analysis is `miracle_in_the_andes.txt`, a literary work included in the repository for demonstration purposes.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

Ensure Python 3.13 is installed on your system. Then, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install nltk matplotlib wordcloud pandas numpy
```

Additionally, download the necessary NLTK data:

```bash
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahmudurmahid/natural-language-processing-for-ebooks.git
cd natural-language-processing-for-ebooks
```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open the desired notebook (e.g., book_analysis_1.ipynb) and execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

## ✅ Testing

Manual testing was conducted to ensure:

- Notebooks execute without errors from start to finish. ✔
- Text preprocessing steps effectively clean and tokenize the data. ✔
- Visualizations accurately represent the analyzed data. ✔
- Results are consistent across multiple runs. ✔
